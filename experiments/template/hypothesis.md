# Hypothesis Statement

## Research Question
What specific question is this experiment designed to answer?

## Null Hypothesis (H₀)
State the null hypothesis clearly and formally.

Example: There is no significant difference in [outcome] between [condition A] and [condition B].

## Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
State the alternative hypothesis.

Example: There is a significant difference in [outcome] between [condition A] and [condition B].

## Statistical Test
- **Test Type:** e.g., t-test, Mann-Whitney U, ANOVA, Chi-square
- **Significance Level (α):** 0.05
- **Power (1-β):** 0.80
- **Expected Effect Size:** e.g., Cohen's d = 0.5

## Success Criteria
What results would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis?

## Assumptions
List the assumptions that must be met for this test:
1. Independence of observations
2. Normality (if parametric)
3. Homogeneity of variance (if applicable)
4. Other relevant assumptions

## Sample Size Calculation
If applicable, show sample size calculations and justification.
