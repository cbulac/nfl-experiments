EXPERIMENT 002: SAFETIES VS CORNERBACKS IN INTERCEPTION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

Created: 2025-11-05
Status: Ready to Execute

OBJECTIVE
---------
Compare safeties (SS, FS, S) and cornerbacks (CB) in interception scenarios,
analyzing their pre-throw positioning, movement, speed, acceleration, and
directional alignment.

EXECUTION STEPS
---------------
1. Verify setup:
   python test_setup.py

2. Load and merge data (5-10 min):
   python scripts/load_and_merge_data.py

3. Engineer features (2-5 min):
   python scripts/engineer_features.py

4. Run analysis (< 1 min):
   python analysis.py

Or run all at once:
   python scripts/load_and_merge_data.py && \
   python scripts/engineer_features.py && \
   python analysis.py

HYPOTHESES TESTED
-----------------
H1: Positioning - Safeties are farther from ball than CBs (one-tailed t-test)
H2: Alignment - Directional alignment differs between groups (two-tailed t-test)
H3: Speed - CBs have higher speed than safeties (one-tailed t-test)
H4: Coverage - Coverage scheme affects position involvement (chi-square/logistic)
H5: Predictors - Different features predict success per position (logistic w/ interactions)

FEATURES ENGINEERED
-------------------
Spatial: initial_dist_to_ball, min_dist_to_ball, dist_from_los
Kinematic: avg_speed, max_speed, speed_at_throw, avg_accel, max_accel
Directional: avg_dir_alignment, avg_orient_alignment, avg_body_control
Temporal: avg_closing_rate, reaction_frame_min
Post-throw: post_throw_distance, final_proximity_to_ball, convergence_distance

DATA REQUIREMENTS
-----------------
Input: data/raw/train/input_2023_wXX.csv (all weeks)
Output: data/raw/train/output_2023_wXX.csv (all weeks)
Supplementary: data/raw/supplementary_data.csv

Interim: data/interim/merged_tracking_data.csv (created by step 1)
Interim: data/interim/engineered_features.csv (created by step 2)

STATISTICAL APPROACH
--------------------
- Significance level: α = 0.01 (Bonferroni corrected for 5 tests)
- Effect size: Cohen's d (small=0.2, medium=0.5, large=0.8)
- Assumptions: Checked via Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's test
- Alternative tests: Welch's t-test if variances unequal

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
Edit config.yaml to modify:
- Weeks to process
- Statistical parameters (alpha, effect size thresholds)
- Feature calculation parameters
- Visualization settings
- Output paths

KEY REFERENCES
--------------
- Strategy document: docs/analysis_strategy_safeties_vs_cornerbacks.md
- README: README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- Quick start: QUICKSTART.md (rapid execution guide)
- Configuration: config.yaml (all parameters)

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
Based on domain knowledge:
- H1: SUPPORTED - Safeties play deeper (large effect)
- H2: UNCERTAIN - Could go either way
- H3: SUPPORTED - CBs are faster (medium effect)
- H4: SUPPORTED - Coverage matters
- H5: SUPPORTED - Different success factors

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Missing files: Check data/raw/ directory has all CSV files
- Module errors: pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
- Memory issues: Reduce weeks in config.yaml
- No results: Check logs/ for detailed error messages

-------
For questions, review README.md or check execution logs in logs/ directory.
