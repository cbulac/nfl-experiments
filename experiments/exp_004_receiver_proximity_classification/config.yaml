# Defender type classification
defender_classification:
  # Primary method: proximity to TARGET RECEIVER at play start
  method: "proximity_rank"

  # Proximity rank method
  proximity_rank:
    # Player with rank 1 (closest to receiver at play start) is primary defender
    primary_rank: 1
    # All other ranks are help defenders
    help_ranks: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Interception identification
interception_identification:
  # Method to identify which player made the interception
  method: "player_to_predict"
